							The founders of the Sea Level Rise Island Peoples Sovereignty
							Coalition were not satisfied with the UN Sustainable Development
							Goals, so we decided to hard-fork the SDG to created our own
							version, which we called the Enhanced Sustainable Development
							Goals (“Enhanced SDG”). With the founders of the Earth Dollar, we
							envision living in a world where all beings on this great planet
							are able to thrive, not just sustained. While the UN’s 17 SDGs are
							a good starting foundation, it only represents a minimum viable
							survival standard. There is a fundamental difference between
							thriving and surviving. Surviving means, “to continue to live or
							exist,” while thrive can be defined as “to grow or develop well,
							to prosper or to flourish.”
						</p>
						<p>
							So, therefore, the founders have “enhanced” the United Nations’
							Sustainable Development Goals to support our vision of a thriving
							world. Thriving happens when people have a life of purpose,
							abundance, vitality, prosperity, connection, and celebration.
							People who are thriving wake up every day excited, full of joy,
							and happy that they are alive. Following the style of the
							blockchain industry, we forked the SDGs and enhanced it to create
							the Enhanced Sustainable Development Goals.

							<h3>01 - No poverty</h3>
							<h4 class="italic">End poverty in all its forms everywhere.</h4>

							<p>
								Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest
								challenges facing humanity. While the number of people living in
								extreme poverty dropped by more than half between 1990 and 2015,
								too many are still struggling for the most basic human needs.
							</p>

							<p>
								As of 2015, about 736 million people still lived on less than
								US$1.90 a day; many lack food, clean drinking water and
								sanitation. Rapid growth in countries such as China and India
								has lifted millions out of poverty, but progress has been
								uneven. Women are more likely to be poor than men because they
								have less paid work, education, and own less property.
							</p>

							<p>
								Progress has also been limited in other regions, such as South
								Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, which account for 80 percent of
								those living in extreme poverty. New threats brought on by
								climate change, conflict and food insecurity, mean even more
								work is needed to bring people out of poverty.
							</p>

							<p>
								The SDGs are a bold commitment to finish what we started, and
								end poverty in all forms and dimensions by 2030. This involves
								targeting the most vulnerable, increasing basic resources and
								services, and supporting communities affected by conflict and
								climate-related disasters.

							<h4 class="italic">
								End hunger, achive food security and improved nutrition and

							</h4>

							<p>
								The number of undernourished people has dropped by almost half
								in the past two decades because of rapid economic growth and
								increased agricultural productivity. Many developing countries
								that used to suffer from famine and hunger can now meet their
								nutritional needs. Central and East Asia, Latin America and the
								Caribbean have all made huge progress in eradicating extreme
								hunger.
							</p>

							<p>
								Unfortunately, extreme hunger and malnutrition remain a huge
								barrier to development in many countries. There are 821 million
								people estimated to be chronically undernourished as of 2017,
								often as a direct consequence of environmental degradation,
								drought and biodiversity loss. Over 90 million children under
								five are dangerously underweight. Undernourishment and severe
								food insecurity appear to be increasing in almost all regions of
								Africa, as well as in South America.
							</p>

							<p>
								The SDGs aim to end all forms of hunger and malnutrition by
								2030, making sure all people–especially children–have sufficient
								and nutritious food all year. This involves promoting
								sustainable agricultural, supporting small-scale farmers and
								equal access to land, technology and markets. It also requires
								international cooperation to ensure investment in infrastructure
								and technology to improve agricultural productivity.

								We have made great progress against several leading causes of

								infant and maternal mortality rates have declined, we’ve turned
								the tide on HIV and malaria deaths have halved.
							</p>

							<p>
								Good health is essential to sustainable development and the 2030
								Agenda reflects the complexity and interconnectedness of the
								two. It takes into account widening economic and social
								inequalities, rapid urbanization, threats to the climate and the
								environment, the continuing burden of HIV and other infectious

								diseases. Universal health coverage will be integral to
								achieving SDG 3, ending poverty and reducing inequalities.
								Emerging global health priorities not explicitly included in the
								SDGs, including antimicrobial resistance, also demand action.
							</p>

							<p>
								But the world is off-track to achieve the health-related SDGs.
								Progress has been uneven, both between and within countries.
								There’s a 31-year gap between the countries with the shortest
								and longest life expectancies. And while some countries have
								made impressive gains, national averages hide that many are

							</h4>

							<p>
								Since 2000, there has been enormous progress in achieving the
								target of universal primary education. The total enrolment rate
								in developing regions reached 91 percent in 2015, and the
								worldwide number of children out of school has dropped by almost
								half. There has also been a dramatic increase in literacy rates,
								and many more girls are in school than ever before. These are
								all remarkable successes.
							</p>

							<p>
								Progress has also been tough in some developing regions due to
								high levels of poverty, armed conflicts and other emergencies.
								In Western Asia and North Africa, ongoing armed conflict has
								seen an increase in the number of children out of school. This
								is a worrying trend. While Sub-Saharan Africa made the greatest
								progress in primary school enrolment among all developing
								regions – from 52 percent in 1990, up to 78 percent in 2012 –
								large disparities still remain. Children from the poorest
								households are up to four times more likely to be out of school
								than those of the richest households. Disparities between rural
								and urban areas also remain high.
							</p>

							<p>
								Achieving inclusive and quality education for all reaffirms the
								belief that education is one of the most powerful and proven
								vehicles for sustainable development. This goal ensures that all
								girls and boys complete free primary and secondary schooling by
								2030. It also aims to provide equal access to affordable
								vocational training, to eliminate gender and wealth disparities,
								and achieve universal access to a quality higher education.

							<p>
								Ending all discrimination against women and girls is not only a
								basic human right, it’s crucial for sustainable future; it’s
								proven that empowering women and girls helps economic growth and
								development.
							</p>

							<p>
								UNDP has made gender equality central to its work and we’ve seen
								remarkable progress in the past 20 years. There are more girls
								in school now compared to 15 years ago, and most regions have
								reached gender parity in primary education.
							</p>

							<p>
								But although there are more women than ever in the labour
								market, there are still large inequalities in some regions, with
								women systematically denied the same work rights as men. Sexual
								violence and exploitation, the unequal division of unpaid care
								and domestic work, and discrimination in public office all
								remain huge barriers. Climate change and disasters continue to
								have a disproportionate effect on women and children, as do
								conflict and migration.
							</p>

							<p>
								It is vital to give women equal rights land and property, sexual
								and reproductive health, and to technology and the internet.
								Today there are more women in public office than ever before,
								but encouraging more women leaders will help achieve greater
								gender equality.

								Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth,

							</h4>

							<p>
								Over the past 25 years the number of workers living in extreme
								poverty has declined dramatically, despite the lasting impact of
								the 2008 economic crisis and global recession. In developing
								countries, the middle class now makes up more than 34 percent of
								total employment – a number that has almost tripled between 1991
								and 2015.
							</p>

							<p>
								However, as the global economy continues to recover we are
								seeing slower growth, widening inequalities, and not enough jobs
								to keep up with a growing labour force. According to the
								International Labour Organization, more than 204 million people
								were unemployed in 2015.
							</p>

							<p>
								The SDGs promote sustained economic growth, higher levels of
								productivity and technological innovation. Encouraging
								entrepreneurship and job creation are key to this, as are
								effective measures to eradicate forced labour, slavery and human
								trafficking. With these targets in mind, the goal is to achieve
								full and productive employment, and decent work, for all women
								and men by 2030.
							</p>
							<p>
								We upgraded Goal 8. While Decent Work is a minimal standard,
								Enjoyable Work is the highest standard we can achieve in the
								work environment. Also, Economic Growth has been changed to
								Implement the Living Economy, a new economic system centered on
								the preservation of all life on the planet. New wealth is
								generated as the Earth is being restored. The United Nations has
								called for 7% GDP growth per annum in the least developed
								countries and higher levels of economic productivity across the
								board, which is contributing to the destruction of our planet.
								This is totally unsustainable. The core of the United Nations’
								SDG program relies on the old paradigm model of indefinite
								economic growth that caused our ecological crisis in the first
								place: ever-increasing levels of extraction, production, and
								consumption. This is a profound contradiction to the heart of
								these supposedly sustainable goals. They call for both less and
								more at the same time.

							<p>
								Income inequality has increased in nearly everywhere in recent

							<p>
								These widening disparities require sound policies to empower

							<p>
								Income inequality requires global solutions. This involves

								Facilitating the safe migration and mobility of people is also

							</p>

							<p>
								The rapid growth of cities—a result of rising populations and

							<p>
								A large share of the world population is still consuming far too
								little to meet even their basic needs. Halving the per capita of

								important for creating more efficient production and supply
								chains. This can help with food security, and shift us towards a

							<h3>13 - Climate action</h3>
							<h4 class="italic">
								Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
							</h4>

							<p>
								There is no country that is not experiencing the drastic effects
								of climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions are more than 50
								percent higher than in 1990. Global warming is causing
								long-lasting changes to our climate system, which threatens
								irreversible consequences if we do not act.
							</p>

							<p>
								The annual average economic losses from climate-related
								disasters are in the hundreds of billions of dollars. This is
								not to mention the human impact of geo-physical disasters, which
								are 91 percent climate-related, and which between 1998 and 2017
								killed 1.3 million people, and left 4.4 billion injured. The
								goal aims to mobilize US$100 billion annually by 2020 to address
								the needs of developing countries to both adapt to climate
								change and invest in low-carbon development.
							</p>

							<p>
								Supporting vulnerable regions will directly contribute not only
								to Goal 13 but also to the other SDGs. These actions must also
								go hand in hand with efforts to integrate disaster risk
								measures, sustainable natural resource management, and human
								security into national development strategies. It is still
								possible, with strong political will, increased investment, and
								using existing technology, to limit the increase in global mean
								temperature to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels,
								aiming at 1.5°C, but this requires urgent and ambitious
								collective action.

							<p>
								The world’s oceans – their temperature, chemistry, currents and
								life – drive global systems that make the Earth habitable for
								humankind. How we manage this vital resource is essential for
								humanity as a whole, and to counterbalance the effects of
								climate change.
							</p>

							<p>
								Over three billion people depend on marine and coastal
								biodiversity for their livelihoods. However, today we are seeing
								30 percent of the world’s fish stocks overexploited, reaching
								below the level at which they can produce sustainable yields.
							</p>

							<p>
								Oceans also absorb about 30 percent of the carbon dioxide
								produced by humans, and we are seeing a 26 percent rise in ocean
								acidification since the beginning of the industrial revolution.
								Marine pollution, an overwhelming majority of which comes from
								land-based sources, is reaching alarming levels, with an average
								of 13,000 pieces of plastic litter to be found on every square
								kilometre of ocean.
							</p>

							<p>
								The SDGs aim to sustainably manage and protect marine and
								coastal ecosystems from pollution, as well as address the
								impacts of ocean acidification. Enhancing conservation and the
								sustainable use of ocean-based resources through international
								law will also help mitigate some of the challenges facing our
								oceans.

							<p>
								Human life depends on the earth as much as the ocean for our
								sustenance and livelihoods. Plant life provides 80 percent of
								the human diet, and we rely on agriculture as an important
								economic resources. Forests cover 30 percent of the Earth’s
								surface, provide vital habitats for millions of species, and
								important sources for clean air and water, as well as being
								crucial for combating climate change.
							</p>

							<p>
								Every year, 13 million hectares of forests are lost, while the
								persistent degradation of drylands has led to the
								desertification of 3.6 billion hectares, disproportionately
								affecting poor communities.
							</p>

							<p>
								While 15 percent of land is protected, biodiversity is still at
								risk. Nearly 7,000 species of animals and plants have been
								illegally traded. Wildlife trafficking not only erodes
								biodiversity, but creates insecurity, fuels conflict, and feeds
								corruption.
							</p>

							<p>
								Urgent action must be taken to reduce the loss of natural

								mitigation and adaptation, and peace and security.

							<p>
								We cannot hope for sustainable development without peace,

								enjoy peace, security and prosperity, while others fall into
								seemingly endless cycles of conflict and violence. This is not

							</p>

							<p>
								Armed violence and insecurity have a destructive impact on a
								country’s development, affecting economic growth, and often
								resulting in grievances that last for generations. Sexual
								violence, crime, exploitation and torture are also prevalent
								where there is conflict, or no rule of law, and countries must
								take measures to protect those who are most at risk.
							</p>

							<p>
								The SDGs aim to significantly reduce all forms of violence, and
								work with governments and communities to end conflict and
								insecurity. Promoting the rule of law and human rights are key
								to this process, as is reducing the flow of illicit arms and
								strengthening the participation of developing countries in the
								institutions of global governance.
							</p>
							<p>
								We change the United Nation’s SDG of “Strong Institutions” to
								“Fair Institutions”. A strong institution can be a dictatorship,
								but not necessarily fair.

							<p>
								The SDGs can only be realized with strong global partnerships
								and cooperation. Official Development Assistance remained steady
								but below target, at US$147 billion in 2017. While humanitarian
								crises brought on by conflict or natural disasters continue to
								demand more financial resources and aid. Many countries also

							</p>

							<p>
								The world is more interconnected than ever. Improving access to

								foster innovation. Coordinating policies to help developing
								countries manage their debt, as well as promoting investment for
								the least developed, is vital for sustainable growth and
								development.
							</p>

							<p>
								The goals aim to enhance North-South and South-South cooperation
								by supporting national plans to achieve all the targets.
								Promoting international trade, and helping developing countries
								increase their exports is all part of achieving a universal
								rules-based and equitable trading system that is fair and open
								and benefits all.
